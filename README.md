# fab.deposit.BXL
Based on the OVN (open value network) from Sensorica in Montreal, this repository intends to create a deposit for FabLabs and Makerspaces in Brussels

What if you could have a tool that mutualize all resources (Machines, materials, knowledge, skills, money) between all partners inside a Fab.City without any complicated protocol or paperwork? You could create occasionally groups of individuals or combine fablabs to tackle a big task and pay each resource that contributed towards the production of something. Sounds great? Well Open Value Network and their Custodian principle are already doing it on a local scale (read more about it on my Montreal article). Maybe Fab.City Global could democratize this system.
